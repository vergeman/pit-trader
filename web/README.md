## Pit Trader Web

Pit Trader Static site video game.

Built on top of [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). Uses [onnx
runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/) to load an [external classifier](../model).

Trained by labeling open-outcry trading pit gesture data generated by [MediaPipe
libraries](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/blob/master/docs/getting_started/javascript.md).

### Quickstart Dev

```

docker-compose up
# visit http://localhost:3000/

# docker env for tests, lint
./docker_run_web.sh

npm test
npm run lint


```

### Basic Architecture

* MediaPipe enables webcam and outputs landmark data points (hands, face.)

* There is an implicit "Game Loop" driven by each webcam frame that triggers a
  re-render of most components.

* Classifier takes webcam data and infers a class label that maps to a gesture
  value.

* When both a quantity gesture and price gesture are recognized, a
  "GestureDecision" triggers; typically an Order submitted to the Matching
  Engine.


#### Gesture Recognition

* A [`Gesture.ts`](src/lib/gesture/Gesture.ts) is a recognized 'snapshot' of
  MediaPipe landmark data from the [`Classifier.ts`](src/lib/gesture/Classifier.ts).
  * Model is currently Logistic Regression, with a manually tuned probability
    threshold of `0.41`.
* [`CameraGesture.jsx#L24`](src/pages/main/CameraGesture.jsx#L24): `calcGesture()`
  function drives the recognition, and is called each webcam frame.
* Gestures are recognized using a mini state machine, using a small timer
  before locking the input and moving to the next component input.
    * [`NumberSM.ts`](src/lib/gesture/NumberSM.ts): recognize numbers
    * [`ActionSM.ts`](src/lib/gesture/ActionSM.ts): recognizes supplemental gestures (Cancel, Market);
* A [`GestureDecision.ts`](src/lib/gesture/GestureDecision.ts) determines if both
  component gestures (a gesture quantity and gesture price) have been set. If
  they're valid, this triggers creation or update (e.g. cancel) of an Order.

#### Gameplay

* [`MarketLoop.ts`](src/lib/exchange/MarketLoop.ts) cycles between
  [NPCs](src/lib/player/NPCPlayerManager.ts) who randomly improve bids or offers
  to induce execution.
* [`Events`](src/lib/event) are randomly triggered that force a gesture matching challenge, or
  update parameters (add players, induce action, etc.)
  * These are indicated by messages displayed on the [`InfoPanel`](src/pages/main/infopanel).
* [`MatchingEngine.ts`](src/lib/exchange/MatchingEngine.ts) matches player [`Orders.ts`](src/lib/exchange/Order.ts) and execution.
* Increased profit increases levels that enables more risk and reward.

#### Dev Notes

* html5 webcam (`navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`) requires secure context -
  can't access from `192.168.*` ip. `localhost` is ok.
